## What is Google Dorking?

**Google Dorking**, also known as **Google Hacking**, refers to using advanced search techniques on Google (or other search engines) to find specific information that is not easily accessible through normal queries. By utilizing **special search strings** (called **Google dorks**), you can apply operators like `site:`, `filetype:`, and `intitle:` to filter and refine search results. This can sometimes unintentionally expose **sensitive information**, **vulnerabilities**, or **files** that were never meant to be publicly available.

### Real-World Applications

- **Bug Bounty Hunting**: Finding vulnerabilities like open directories or misconfigured security settings.
- **OSINT**: Gathering public data about individuals or companies.
- **Cybersecurity Audits**: Identifying unprotected files or sensitive information that may be publicly accessible due to misconfigura

### Example: Searching for "Tesla"

In a basic Google search for "Tesla," you see a variety of results related to the company, its cars, news, and more:

![Example-Result-1](bimgs/google-dorking/example-result-1.png) 
*This shows a standard Google search result page for the term "Tesla."*

### Narrowing Down Results with Google Dorking

However, if you only want to view results that belong to Tesla's official domain, you can use the `site:` operator to focus on a specific domain.

To do this, simply use the search string:  
```
site:tesla.com
```

Here’s what it looks like:

![Example-Result-2](bimgs/google-dorking/example-result-2.png)  
*This filtered search displays only pages from tesla.com, effectively removing unrelated results from the search.*

It looks like you're diving deeper into using **Google Dorking** by refining search results further, specifically excluding subdomains. Here's how you can structure that section in your presentation:


### Let’s Deep Dive Into It

In some cases, you might want to exclude specific subdomains from your search results. For example, if you don't want to see results from **shop.tesla.com**, you can modify the query to exclude that subdomain.

#### Excluding Subdomains from Results

You can use the `-` operator to remove certain terms from the search. For instance, to exclude the **shop** subdomain of Tesla, the search string would look like this:

```
site:tesla.com -shop
```

Here’s what happens:

![Example-Result-3](bimgs/google-dorking/example-result-3.png)  
*Initial search without filtering subdomains like "shop"*

Now, after applying the exclusion:

![Example-Result-4](bimgs/google-dorking/example-result-4.png)   
*As you can see, the "shop" subdomain results have been excluded from the search.*

### Explanation:

- **`site:tesla.com`** — Limits the results to the main Tesla domain and its subdomains.
- **`-shop`** — Excludes any results that contain the word "shop," effectively removing **shop.tesla.com** from the results.

This technique is useful when you want to narrow down the results by removing irrelevant sections of a site, helping you focus on specific content.

## Operators

Google Dorking leverages a variety of powerful search operators that allow you to filter and refine search results with precision. These operators provide control over how Google interprets and retrieves results, enabling you to uncover hidden data or focus on specific aspects of web pages.

## Using Quotation Marks for Precise Searches

In **Google Dorking**, you can use quotation marks (`""`) to search for **exact phrases** or words in the same order, ensuring more precise results. This is especially useful when you want to find pages containing specific text combinations or when exact matches are necessary.
#### How to Use Quotation Marks

To search for an exact phrase, place it within quotation marks:

```
"exact phrase"
```

Example By using the query:

```
site:.com intitle:"index of"
```

You can filter for pages across `.com` domains where the title exactly matches **"index of"**, often indicating exposed file directories or unprotected file structures on the web.

## Using the `intitle:` Operator

The `intitle:` operator in **Google Dorking** is a powerful tool that lets you search for web pages containing a specific word or phrase within the **title** of the page. The **title** refers to the text within the `<title>` HTML tag, which appears in both the browser tab and search engine results.

### How to Use `intitle:`

To target pages with a specific word in the title, you can structure your query as follows:

```
intitle:query
```

For example:
```
intitle:login
```

This query will return web pages that include the word **login** in their title.

### Example: Searching for Login Pages

If you want to find **login pages** across various websites, you can combine the `intitle:` operator with a domain filter like so:

```
site:.com intitle:login
```

This query will search for login pages from websites with a `.com` domain. Here's an example of how it works:

![Login-Results](bimgs/google-dorking/login-result.png)  
*Search results showing pages where "login" appears in the title.*

### Understanding the Source Code

To see how this works behind the scenes, you can inspect the **source code** of any webpage by right-clicking and selecting "View Page Source." Inside the HTML, you'll find the `<title>` tag:

![Source_Code-Result](bimgs/google-dorking/source_code.png)   
Here, you can see the relevant portion of the code:

```html
<title>Login Manager</title>
```

Because "Login" is in the title of this page, it shows up in your search results using the `intitle:login` query.

### Finding Open Directories

Using the query:

```
site:.com intitle:"index of"
```

Can help locate **directory listings** or **file directories** that might be publicly accessible, revealing potential vulnerabilities or sensitive information.

![Index-Of-Result](bimgs/google-dorking/index-of.png)   
*Example of search results showing pages with "index of" in the title, often indicating open directories.*

### Potential Uses and Implications

- **Vulnerabilities**: Open directories can expose sensitive files or information unintentionally. This can be a security risk if not properly secured.
  
- **SEO Purposes**: Sometimes, directory listings are intentionally left open for SEO reasons or to improve site navigation. Webmasters might use such listings to help users find files or resources more easily.

Understanding the context in which these directories are used is important for both security analysis and web development. 


## Using the `address:` Operator

The `address:` operator isn't a standard search feature in Google, but with **Google Dorking**, you can use alternative methods and operators to effectively find addresses or locations by combining various operators creatively.

### Finding Specific Addresses or Locations

Here are some approaches to uncover addresses or locations using Google Dorking:

### Using the `site:` Operator for Subdomains

If you want to search for address-related information on a specific website or subdomain, you can use the `site:` operator in combination with relevant keywords. This can be helpful for finding store locations, offices, or other geographic information.

#### Example: Searching for Tesla Store Addresses

To find stores in the United States on Tesla's website, you can structure your search like this:

```
site:tesla.com address:stores in united states
```

![Address-Result-1](bimgs/google-dorking/address-result-1.png) 
*Search results showing Tesla store locations in the United States.*

This query focuses on results from **tesla.com** that mention "address" and "stores" within the United States.

### 2. Using Google Maps for Address Searches

For more precise location searches, **Google Maps** can be a more direct tool. You can pair specific location types (like restaurants, shops, or offices) with keywords in a query to narrow down locations.

#### Example: Searching for Pizza Places in Kerala

You can use the `intitle:` operator combined with a specific location like this:

```
intitle:pizza address:kerala
```

![Address-Result-2](bimgs/google-dorking/address-result-2.png)
*Results showing pizza places with addresses in Kerala.*

This method helps find specific businesses or locations based on the keywords and address details provided.

Even though Google doesn't have a direct `address:` operator, combining other operators such as `site:`, `intitle:`, and keywords related to addresses can help you locate specific information. Google Maps can also be used as a complementary tool for finding addresses and locations.

## Using the `intext:` Operator

The **`intext:`** operator in **Google Dorking** is used to search for specific words or phrases **within the body text** of a web page. This operator is particularly useful for finding content where the keyword appears **in the text**, but not necessarily in the title, URL, or other metadata of the page.

### How to Use `intext:`

To locate pages with a specific keyword or phrase in the content, use this format:

```
intext:keyword
```

### Example:

If you're searching for pages containing the word **"login"** within the body text of `.com` websites, you would use the following query:

```
site:.com intext:login
```

This query will return pages from `.com` domains where the word **"login"** appears in the text of the page.

Similarly, if you want to search for pages containing the word **"confidential"** within `.edu` websites, you can use:

```
site:.edu intext:confidential
```

[Intext-Result-1](bimgs/google-dorking/intext-result-1.png)  
*Example results showing pages where "login" or "confidential" appears in the content.*

### Breakdown:

- **`intext:login`** — Filters results to show pages where the word **login** appears in the body text.
- **`site:.com`** — Restricts the search to `.com` domains, refining the scope of your search.
- **`site:.edu`** — Restricts the search to `.edu` domains for academic or educational results.

### Use Cases

- **Finding Content**: The `intext:` operator is perfect for locating specific content or keywords **within the body** of web pages.
- **Security Research**: Useful for identifying pages that reference **login** or **sensitive information**, even if the term isn’t in the title or URL.
- **Information Gathering**: Helps gather content on specific topics from within a large number of pages, especially useful in OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) investigations.

Using the `intext:` operator makes it easier to narrow down relevant pages based on the **actual content** within a page, providing more targeted results for security researchers and information gatherers alike.

## Comparing `intitle:` vs `intext:` Operators

When performing advanced searches with **Google Dorking**, knowing how to use the **`intitle:`** and **`intext:`** operators effectively can greatly improve the precision of your search results. Both operators target different parts of a web page, and understanding their differences is key to refining your queries.

### `intitle:` Operator

- **Purpose**: Searches for web pages where the specified word or phrase appears in the **title** of the page.
- **Usage**: Best for finding pages where the keyword is central to the content and likely to be summarized in the title.

**Syntax:**
```
intitle:keyword
```

**Example:**
```
intitle:login
```
This query returns web pages where the word "login" appears in the **title**, such as login portals or login-related articles.

**Use Cases**:
- **Finding Specific Page Types**: Ideal for locating pages like **login portals**, **admin panels**, or pages centered around specific subjects (e.g., "login" or "admin").
- **High Relevance**: Titles are usually written to highlight the main topic of a page, making these results highly relevant to your query.

**Example Query:**
To search for login pages on `.com` domains:
```
site:.com intitle:login
```
This query returns results where "login" appears in the title on websites with a `.com` domain.

### `intext:` Operator

- **Purpose**: Searches for pages containing the specified word or phrase in the **body text** of the page.
- **Usage**: Useful when you need to find pages where the keyword or phrase appears anywhere in the content, even if it’s not the primary focus of the page.

**Syntax:**
```
intext:keyword
```

**Example:**
```
intext:login
```
This query returns pages where the word "login" appears in the **body text**, not limited to the title or URL.

**Use Cases**:
- **Broad Content Searches**: Helpful for finding pages that discuss a particular keyword within the text, such as explanations or mentions of "login" within a larger article or discussion.
- **Comprehensive Search**: Unlike `intitle:`, the keyword may appear anywhere on the page, so the results cover a wider scope.

**Example Query:**
To find pages discussing login information on `.com` websites:
```
site:.com intext:login
```
This query shows pages where "login" appears somewhere in the body text of `.com` websites.

### Summary

- **`intitle:`**: Targets keywords in the **title**, giving focused results where the keyword is a central theme or topic of the page.
- **`intext:`**: Targets keywords in the **body text**, providing broader results where the keyword appears anywhere in the content, even if it’s not the main focus.

Using these operators, either individually or combined, allows for tailored searches. For instance, pairing `intitle:` with `intext:` can help locate pages that both discuss a keyword and feature it prominently in the title, offering highly relevant and comprehensive search results.

## Using the `filetype:` Operator

The **`filetype:`** operator in **Google Dorking** is a powerful tool for locating specific types of files on the web by filtering search results to include only files with a particular extension. This operator is valuable for finding various documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and other file types.

### How to Use `filetype:`

To search for files of a specific type, use the following syntax:

```
filetype:extension keyword
```

- **`extension`**: The file extension you are targeting (e.g., pdf, docx, xls).
- **`keyword`**: The term or phrase you want to find within those files.

### Example Usage

1. **Finding PDF Files:**

   To locate **PDF files** related to **"cybersecurity"**, you would use:

   ```
   filetype:pdf cybersecurity
   ```

   ![Filetype-PDF-Result](bimgs/google-dorking/filetype-pdf-result.png)  
    *This query returns PDF documents that include the term **"cybersecurity"**.*

2. **Finding Word Documents:**

   To find **DOCX files** mentioning **"project plan"**, use:

   ```
   filetype:docx project plan
   ```

   This will return DOCX files containing the phrase **"project plan"**.

3. **Finding Excel Spreadsheets:**

   To search for **Excel files** related to **"financial reports"**, use:

   ```
   filetype:xls financial reports
   ```

   This query displays Excel spreadsheets that mention **"financial reports"**.

4. **Finding CSV Files:**

   For discovering **CSV files** that might contain data, use:

   ```
   filetype:csv data
   ```

   Many sites store data in CSV format, so this query can help find potentially sensitive information.

   ![Filetype-Result-CSV](bimgs/google-dorking/filetype-csv-result.png)  
    *This query can uncover CSV files that may contain valuable or sensitive data.*

### How It Works

- **`filetype:` Operator**: Filters search results to include files with a specified extension.
- **Keyword**: The term or phrase that should appear in the content of the files.

### Use Cases

- **Finding Specific Documents**: Ideal for locating particular types of documents, such as **technical reports**, **academic papers**, or **business plans**.
- **Research and Data Gathering**: Useful for accessing detailed information or datasets often stored in formats like PDF, DOCX, or XLS.
- **Security and Vulnerability Assessment**: Helps identify exposed documents or files that might contain **sensitive or confidential information**.

Using the `filetype:` operator can streamline your search for specific types of files, making it easier to gather information or assess vulnerabilities based on file contents available on the web.

## Using the `link:` Operator

The **`link:`** operator in Google search is used to find web pages that contain links to a specific URL or domain. This operator can be quite useful for identifying which sites are linking back to a particular page, making it valuable for tasks like backlink analysis and competitive research.

### How to Use `link:`

To search for pages that link to a particular URL or domain, use the following format:

### Example Usage

1. **Finding Links to Tesla on Specific Domains:**

   To find pages that link to **Tesla** and are hosted on a `.in` domain, you can use:

   ```
   link:tesla.com site:.in
   ```

   ![Link-Result-In](bimgs/google-dorking/link-result-in.png)  
   This query returns pages on `.in` domains that contain links to **tesla.com**.

2. **Finding Bug Bounty Reports:**

   To locate bug bounty reports or discussions related to Tesla on Bugcrowd, use:

   ```
   link:tesla.com site:bugcrowd.com
