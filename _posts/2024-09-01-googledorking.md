This front matter provides a concise overview of your presentation on Google Dorking, categorizing it appropriately and adding relevant tags to improve discoverability. Let me know if you need any adjustments or additional sections!

## What is Google Dorking?

**Google Dorking**, also known as **Google Hacking**, refers to using advanced search techniques on Google (or other search engines) to find specific information that is not easily accessible through normal queries. By utilizing **special search strings** (called **Google dorks**), you can apply operators like `site:`, `filetype:`, and `intitle:` to filter and refine search results. This can sometimes unintentionally expose **sensitive information**, **vulnerabilities**, or **files** that were never meant to be publicly available.

### Example: Searching for "Tesla"

In a basic Google search for "Tesla," you see a variety of results related to the company, its cars, news, and more:

![Result1](bimgs/result1.png) 
*This shows a standard Google search result page for the term "Tesla."*

#### Narrowing Down Results with Google Dorking

However, if you only want to view results that belong to Tesla's official domain, you can use the `site:` operator to focus on a specific domain.

To do this, simply use the search string:  
```
site:tesla.com
```

Here’s what it looks like:

![Result2](bimgs/result2.png)  
*This filtered search displays only pages from tesla.com, effectively removing unrelated results from the search.*

It looks like you're diving deeper into using **Google Dorking** by refining search results further, specifically excluding subdomains. Here's how you can structure that section in your presentation:


### Let’s Deep Dive Into It

In some cases, you might want to exclude specific subdomains from your search results. For example, if you don't want to see results from **shop.tesla.com**, you can modify the query to exclude that subdomain.

#### Excluding Subdomains from Results

You can use the `-` operator to remove certain terms from the search. For instance, to exclude the **shop** subdomain of Tesla, the search string would look like this:

```
site:tesla.com -shop
```

Here’s what happens:

![Result3](bimgs/result3.png)  
*Initial search without filtering subdomains like "shop"*

Now, after applying the exclusion:

![Result4](bimgs/result4.png)   
*As you can see, the "shop" subdomain results have been excluded from the search.*
### Explanation:

- **`site:tesla.com`** — Limits the results to the main Tesla domain and its subdomains.
- **`-shop`** — Excludes any results that contain the word "shop," effectively removing **shop.tesla.com** from the results.

This technique is useful when you want to narrow down the results by removing irrelevant sections of a site, helping you focus on specific content.


## Using the `intitle:` Operator

The `intitle:` operator in **Google Dorking** is a powerful tool that lets you search for web pages containing a specific word or phrase within the **title** of the page. The **title** refers to the text within the `<title>` HTML tag, which appears in both the browser tab and search engine results.

#### How to Use `intitle:`

To target pages with a specific word in the title, you can structure your query as follows:

```
intitle:query
```

For example:
```
intitle:login
```

This query will return web pages that include the word **login** in their title.

### Example: Searching for Login Pages

If you want to find **login pages** across various websites, you can combine the `intitle:` operator with a domain filter like so:

```
site:.com intitle:login
```

This query will search for login pages from websites with a `.com` domain. Here's an example of how it works:

![Result5](bimgs/result5.png)  
*Search results showing pages where "login" appears in the title.*

### Understanding the Source Code

To see how this works behind the scenes, you can inspect the **source code** of any webpage by right-clicking and selecting "View Page Source." Inside the HTML, you'll find the `<title>` tag:

![Result6](bimgs/result6.png)   
Here, you can see the relevant portion of the code:

```html
<title>Login Manager</title>
```

Because "Login" is in the title of this page, it shows up in your search results using the `intitle:login` query.
