Hey guys, I'm Nijith Wilson — you can call me **neosploit**! 😎
After a long break, I’m back on the blog. Let’s jump into **OSINT Exercise 003**, continuing our geo-location challenges.

## Task Briefing

In April 2017, Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo, the then-president of Somalia, visited Turkey. A news agency published a photo showing him shaking hands with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the President of Turkey. The article didn’t reveal the location where the photo was taken.

Your mission:
**Identify the name and GPS coordinates of the location in the image.**

**Difficulty:**

* **Beginners**: Medium
* **Experts**: Easy


## Step 1: Image Analysis

!\[\[Pasted image 20250802094302.png]]

We see two national flags — Turkish and Somali — suggesting a formal government meeting. The background features a large golden building with glass panels and a red emblem at the top. This hints at an official or presidential building.

So... let’s start with **Google Reverse Image Search**.

!\[\[Pasted image 20250802195953.png]]

In the results, I found some media reports and social media posts featuring this image.

Naturally, my attention went to **Instagram**. Why? Because psychologically, people tend to post real-time and short-captioned content there, making it useful for fast clues.

Boom. Got it.


## Step 2: Clue From Instagram

The post by `communications_turkiyee` had this caption:

> *"President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia at the Presidential Complex..."*

The caption clearly mentions:
📍 **Presidential Complex, Turkey**

## Step 3: Confirm the Location

Next, I Googled **"Turkish Presidential Complex"**, and yeah — 100% match.

I found **more images** with the same golden building, red emblem, and glass structure — confirming the background from our task.


## Step 4: Get the Coordinates

Open Google Maps, search **Presidential Complex Turkey**, and click on “Directions.” Since it’s a restricted government building, there's no Street View. But the coordinates are available!

🎯 **Coordinates:**
`39.930305040643155, 32.79637191853982`


## Bonus Tip

You can use AI tools like **ChatGPT** to help guide your thinking. But don’t fully rely on it — use it as a brainstorming partner. In OSINT, AI can help narrow the path, but **you** have to verify.


## Final Answer

* 📍 **Location**: Presidential Complex, Ankara, Turkey
* 🌐 **Coordinates**: `39.930305040643155, 32.79637191853982`


### OSINT isn't just about tools. It's about observation, pattern recognition, and verifying clues.

Thanks for joining me in this mission. Stay sharp, stay curious — more exercises coming soon!
