Hey guys, I'm Nijith Wilson — you can call me **neosploit**! 😎
After a long break, I’m back on the blog. Let’s jump into **OSINT Exercise 003**, continuing our geo-location challenges.

## Task Briefing

In April 2017, Mohamed Abdullahi Farmaajo, the then-president of Somalia, visited Turkey. A news agency published a photo showing him shaking hands with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the President of Turkey. The article didn’t reveal the location where the photo was taken.

Your mission:
**Identify the name and GPS coordinates of the location in the image.**

**Difficulty:**

* **Beginners**: Medium
* **Experts**: Easy


## Step 1: Image Analysis

Start by taking a long, detailed look. Forget assumptions — focus on **what you actually see**.

#### The Red Emblem & Flags

We see two flags: one Turkish 🇹🇷, the other Somali 🇸🇴. Right above them? A **red circular emblem** with gold design — this is a key marker. If you’ve ever studied national seals, you’ll recognize it as **the Presidential Seal of Turkey**.

#### Architecture Hints

The grand golden doors, glass panels, symmetry — all scream **official government**. That entrance is not your everyday hotel or event hall.

### Google Reverse Image Search

So... let’s start with **Google Reverse Image Search**.

![Search-Result](/assets/img/bposts/geo-osint-exercise-03/google-result.png)

In the results, I found some media reports and social media posts featuring this image.

Naturally, my attention went to **Instagram**.

Why? Because psychologically, people tend to post real-time and short-captioned content there, making it useful for fast clues.


## Step 2: Clue From Instagram Post

Boom. Got it.


The post by `communications_turkiyee` had this caption:

> *"President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan met with President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia at the Presidential Complex..."*

The caption clearly mentions:
📍 **Presidential Complex, Turkey**

## Step 3: Confirm the Location

Next, I Googled **"Turkish Presidential Complex"**,

Here we go we got similar entrance bulding images

I found **more images** with the same golden building, red emblem, and glass structure — confirming the background from our task.
so 100% Confirm

I cant show more images becuase more images from google are licensed

## Step 4: Get the Coordinates

Simple Be smart search **Presidential Complex Turkey** on google map or goole search and click on “Directions.”

Since it’s a restricted government building, there's no Street View. But the coordinates are available!

**Coordinates:**
`39.93091069459019, 32.79907204853644`

>  **Bonus Tip**
> 
> You can use AI tools like **ChatGPT** to help guide your thinking, but don’t rely on them completely. Use AI as a **brainstorming partner**, not a final authority.  
> In OSINT, AI can help narrow down possibilities — but **verification is your job**.

## Final Answer

* 📍 **Location**: Presidential Complex, Ankara, Turkey
* 🌐 **Coordinates**: `39.930305040643155, 32.79637191853982`
